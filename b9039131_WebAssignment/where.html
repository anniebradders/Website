					<p>A takeaway like no other. If asked where I think we should eat this location will always be broguht up. If gone missing around the hours of dinner or lunchtime I can potentially be found lurking outside the doors of this place.</p>

					<p>A night club which hasn't been opened in months. Throughout first year I could be found here tuesday and thursday nights. Their 90p drinks on tuesdays and celebrity guests on mean that students flock to this location.

					<p>A bar like no other. Located at the far end of the moor it is a trek for most people to take. However once there it is worth it, the pub downstairs leads to a flase perception of this place as its upstairs in their nightclub where people truly enjoy their nights.

					<p>A indepdent coffee shop where I can be found studying and working on assignments. Even though I depise the taste of coffee I can be found sipping on a cup of tea or eating one of their many pasteries/cakes.
